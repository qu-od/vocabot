it's a piece of identity who gets lost...

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:50:39.843000
I'm trying to put myself in a similar position but eh, can't realize empathize that much

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:50:43.220000
you know a lot about Belgium üôÇ

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:51:14.557000
It's not really getting lost, it's just the language evolving itself

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:51:29.657000
You could say the same about languages from 2000years ago

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:51:42.057000
But it's too far a way to feel a strong cultural connection

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:51:47.757000
well, in the case with Flemish, if you poeple stop speaking it, it will be lost

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:52:12.342000
true

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:52:12.614000
Why would they keep speaking it without the cultural reasons?

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:52:38.165000
because it is ours, our land, our language üôÇ

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:53:05.339000
i mean, it is just my view, might be stupid, but i feel closer to my language, than to my country

–µ–∫—Å—Ö–∏–ª–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω - 2020-04-24 19:53:42.289000
It's normal I believe, I feel somewhat of a underground connection even how much I try to avoid it

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:53:43.927000
it is a unique bond , between a few poeple

Kenzo - 2020-04-24 19:56:41.597000
